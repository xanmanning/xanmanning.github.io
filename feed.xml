when issuing push/pulls to a git repository over HTTPS, run the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git config credential.helper store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will remember your username and password by storing in a plaintext file
in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;${HOME}/.git-credentials&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: Only do this if you know your home directory is secure from

  &lt;li&gt;An NFS server for Persistent Volumes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Kubernetes Nodes (1 master, 2 workers). This can be increased in Vagrant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the below demo I go from sourcecode, to a 3 node cluster + storage in 15

gone away to watch Foo Fighters. I’m not jealous, I’m not fond of crowds and I
don’t like travelling to London (or down South in general). When I win the
lottery and can afford to have private gigs for my family then all will be cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, on a weekend when I am on my own I can be a bit of a sad nut, especially
on weekends like this one when I will be starting a week of on-call for work. I
often find on-call quite traumatic, particularly as I can be a bit of a
&lt;em&gt;“Sev 1 Magnet”&lt;/em&gt; as my colleagues would describe me. This is another story,
which I will discuss at some later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try and keep myself distracted in these times of heightened anxiety,
maintaining my sanity and avoiding exacerbating an existing health concern I
like to use the time to upskill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve had my early morning walk and exercise, I have decided to learn
&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; properly. I’ve dabbled with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit now and some of the tooling around
it but I’ve not had the opportunity to use K8s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a firm believer of implementing &lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure and Configuration as
Code&lt;/strong&gt;, I’ve decided I’m going to apply the rigour of everything I do being
committed to a git repository as either &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com/&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io/&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; code, sat beneath the Kubernetes
deployment YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this may take a few weekends for me to progress but I’m that much of
a sad nut when I’ve got a weekend to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2018/06/dreadfort_large.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018/06/dreadfort.png&quot; alt=&quot;The command center, Dreadfort&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing is first, time to test the deployment of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube&quot;&gt;Minikube&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl&quot;&gt;Kubectl&lt;/a&gt; in my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vagrantup.com/&quot;&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt; environment using Ansible, before
deploying to my “Production” environment and getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like overkill, I know, but without this kind of rigour mistakes might
be made that costs me more in time. As we all know, operations time is expensive
and my time is valuable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to share some of my code as a “playground” repository soon that
demonstrates the process of going from “code + public cloud provider” to
“functioning Kubernetes Cluster”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Xan Manning</name></author><summary type="html">I’ve got a weekend to myself, it’s not uncommon, but this weekend the wife has gone away to watch Foo Fighters.

middle of contributing to a project at work to combine our multiple knowledgebases
into a single repository of runbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve chosen to resolve our fractured information repositories into a central
git repository. Each runbook is written in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-why-use-git-on-github-and-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;So why use Git (on GitHub) and Markdown?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Runbooks live close to the code, eventually commonly used runbooks can
become Ansible playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Markdown is fairly easy to learn, you don’t need to know how to code to
contribute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Markdown is still ledgible when not rendered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every contributor and consumer has a full copy of the repository offline
so should be able to read their content in a datacenter where there is no
internet connectivity available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contributors have to follow a workflow that means the content is peer
reviewed before being able to merge into the master branch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every document is versioned and changes audited with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git blame&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple people can contribute to a single runbook prior to publication
and the merging of their work is handled well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-challenges-have-been-faced&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What challenges have been faced?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say there is a period of adjustment required. With our knowledge and
experiences “documented” loosly in Google Sites pages, wikis, support tickets,
notes on people’s desks and in our heads - every person has their own workflow
for “documentation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to consider is that the content of this documentation is very
technical in nature and written by some very skilled individuals, but written
by individuals who don’t write a lot of code day-to-day and may not have used
git before. What problems does this cause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git has a steep learning curve when starting off, understanding the workflow
takes a significant commitment of time. This time commitment is not easy
to fulfil when working in Operations or Consultancy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git has its roots in development, after all Linus Torvalds wrote it to
fulfil an SCM role in Linux Kernel Development. The workflows have to be
explained and adapted slightly differently for writting documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tooling is tricky, GUIs can be a bit hit and miss with the level of control
over your project. CLI isn’t as easy to set up on Windows as on Linux/MacOS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rendering of Markdown locally can differ from the rendering on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are a lot of steps in the process to publish a document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-we-do-to-make-things-easier&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can we do to make things easier?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Chia, GitLab, presented “Empowering non-developers to use Git” at
Git Merge 2018. Chia reduced the problem down into 3 requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something to version&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somewhere to publish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some way to stop explosions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already established points 1. and 2. - We are versioning runbooks and then
we are publishing to GitHub. What we have started looking at but not perfected
is point 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 3. is currenlty being managed by manual steps, which is fine, but it takes
a lot of engineer time and commitment. Mistakes can also be made and a non-consistent,
“ad-hoc” process is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we start delving into stopping explosions? We can reduce the engineer hours
involved in publishing content by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint&quot;&gt;linting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aspell.net/&quot;&gt;spellchecking&lt;/a&gt;*, ensuring the correct template was used,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes part of our Continuous Integration (CI) strategy, and starts to
drive the behaviours for writing more consistent runbook entries (in sourcecode
and content).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;* spellchecking is not always easy in technical documents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-do-we-go-once-we-have-implemented-continuous-integration&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do we go once we have implemented continuous integration?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above with point 3. we are starting to look at continuous integration
to stop our explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can actually re-iterate on the problem by looking back at point 2. and how
we publish. We are relying on GitHub as a platform to publish on, making use of
the markdown to HTML conversion that goes on in the background against a GitHub
repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great, but not everyone in the organisation will use GitHub to consume
content. How might we tackle this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub actually supports hosting websites (like this one), written in markdown
but presented in converted HTML. This is done using a Static Site Generator
(SSG), such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.getpelican.com/&quot;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are even SSGs that are designed for formatting technical documentation.
Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/&quot;&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mkdocs.org/&quot;&gt;MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are tools to build our markdown as a site, whilst we are already
checking the sourcecode with our CI solution, we can then start deploying it
automatically. So begins our possible new Continuous Delivery (CD) strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-on-youtube&quot;&gt;Video on YouTube&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the full video of William Chia’s talk, which quite accurately describes
the issues face when non-technical (or even non-development) users are asked to
work in git. The video gives a taste of the solutions used at GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve just been super busy being a geek. I’m still
trying to continue my AWS education but this has been put on hold for some Azure
training. I’m slowly becoming quite cloud agnostic and trying to be smart with
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here’s a rundown of what I have been doing over the past 6 months…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refining my Ansible skills (mainly for work).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Playing with Terraform (personally more than professionally).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning more about Azure through training and &lt;abbr title=&quot;Behavior Driven Development&quot;&gt;BDD&lt;/abbr&gt; (very recent)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provisioning my own services using the infrastructure-as-code tools across
AWS, Azure and Digital Ocean (GCP to follow). I’ve created my own networks,
defined my VPNs (Tinc), carved up my subnets and set up some DNS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I proclaim. I’m doing, but I’m not posting anything particularly
interesting yet. I don’t have much to really show apart from odd bits of boring
ansible output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may draw the odd network diagram to describe what I have built for my cloud “lab”
environments. I may release some of the roles I have written, especially anything
that might be generic and helpful enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, you’ll have to just settle for some Ansible output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018/05/ansible_controller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ansible controller&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oh-yeh-i-got-my-black-belt&quot;&gt;Oh yeh! I got my black belt!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my wife and I got our next grade in karate, December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

end of the day automatically using a combination of Lambda and CloudWatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/11/lambda_ec2_shutdown.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lambda Function&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR I’ve written a ‘stop EC2’ Lambda function that is deployable with
Terraform to get you started, I’ve not made a ‘start EC2’ Lambda function yet.
Future improvements, I’d like to programmatically schedule instances using tags.
Clone from: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xanmanning/terraform-autostop&quot;&gt;github.com/xanmanning/terraform-autostop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we will end up with is a simple Lambda function that will search all of
our regions and automatically send the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stop-instances&lt;/code&gt; command to anything
that is still running after 8:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this I will also be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io/&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; as the
process is then repeatable and can be versioned in git. I am fairly new to
Terraform but I honestly cannot understand how I ever survived without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/11/doyoueventerraform.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Do you even Terraform?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asked on numerous occasions, at different employers “How do I stop
(and start) Amazon EC2 instances at regular intervals?”, and I stumbled upon an
article written by AWS that uses
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/start-stop-lambda-cloudwatch/&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this knowledge base article is quite basic, you effectively write two Lambda
functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shut down a specific instance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start a specific instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then use the time based event in CloudWatch to trigger this Lambda function.
It’s kind of like writing a Python script on your VM and triggering it in cron -
although you obviously cannot power on that machine with cron. I started looking
at other solutions and came across this guide December 2016 when exploring
turning development EC2 instances of an API platform off and on to a schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/solutions-reference/ec2-scheduler/latest/ec2-scheduler.pdf&quot;&gt;EC2 Scheduler Implementation Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s great, but with a need to use a DynamoDB table it felt over engineered
for what we needed at the time. What I wanted was something in the middle of
these two solutions - scheduling tagged instances without a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I was not able to build a solution due to a need to change employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to November 2017 and I have been asked again for my thoughts on
using Lambda functions for scheduling EC2s. For my own proof of concept I wanted
to programmatically look for EC2 instances in any AWS region that is tagged for
automatic shutdown. For an EC2 to be automatically shut down at the end of the
day (8:00pm) the EC2 requires the tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AutoShutdown: True&lt;/code&gt;. Below is the
Python 2.7 Lambda function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Autostop EC2 Lambda POC script.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# xmanning - 2017&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;__future__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;boto3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Poweroff time (24h format)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;poweroff_time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lambda_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([],[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as mentioned, I like to use Terraform for managing my AWS infrastructure.
It means I can spin up and tear down all my musings at a moments notice. There
is one thing to note with AWS Lambda and Terraform, loading a function is not
quite as straight forward as pointing your Terraform config to a .py file. You
either have to upload the script to an S3 bucket or archive it into a .zip file
to which you need to work out the sha256 hash of that file. Luckily Terraform
will work out this hash but creating/updating the .zip file is a bit of a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;aws_lambda_function&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;stop_ec2_instances&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.lambda_stop_ec2_payload.zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;function_name&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;stop_ec2_instances&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Shuts down unused EC2 instances.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;role&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;${aws_iam_role.lambda_start_stop_ec2.arn}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;stop_ec2.lambda_handler&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source_code_hash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;${base64sha256(file(&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;lambda_stop_ec2_payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;))}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;python2.7&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this I have created a simple bash script that wraps around the Terraform
binary. I recommend this as it will speed up your workflow for deploying to
Lambda. My bash script works by firstly compressing the Python scripts in the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;payloads/&lt;/code&gt; directory and then runs the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;terraform plan/apply&lt;/code&gt; functions -
on the fly generating the .zip files and the associated has for upload to
AWS Lambda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;build_payloads&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    info &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Building payload files.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;__PWD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;payloads
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;file &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        info &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Adding &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; to .lambda_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;_payload.zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        zip &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-r9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;../.lambda_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;_payload.zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
            fatal &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Could not build payload files&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;__PWD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Change the tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AutoShutdown: True&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PowerSchedule: 0800;2000&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Create a Start function that also reads the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PowerSchedule&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have the option for a ‘default’ schedule for untagged instances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exempt EC2s for Stop/Start with a specific tags, eg. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Production&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Please
do not be alarmed! As I am not able to put significant time into keeping a
server running nginx and Ghost up to date with security updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/11/jekyll_logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jekyll&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why choose Jekyll? It’s still markdown, it can be pretty and the output is
static HTML. I no longer have a node.js application and database to worry about,
at the moment all I have is the nginx webserver to keep on top of which can be
automatically updated.&lt;/p&gt;

Since February I have been doing a bit of work on IBM AIX systems, particularly with PowerHA (HACMP) clusters. I’m not going to pretend to be an expert but I have found using UNIX almost like speaking a strange dialect or creole. Everything is so similar and yet so very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising that this is the case because of the exciting history of UNIX and the emergence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; (GNU’s Not UNIX) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering2.berkeley.edu/labnotes/history_unix.html&quot;&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt; (Berkeley Software Distribution of UNIX). Unsuprisingly, packages are regularly ported between GNU/Linux and BSD. Even more surprising is seeing the odd GNU package on IBM AIX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016 I’ve been dipping my toes into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbsd.org/&quot;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; and to help myself get started I have been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Absolute-OpenBSD-Unix-Practical-Paranoid/dp/1593274769&quot;&gt;Absolute OpenBSD: UNIX for the Practical Paranoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/09/20170923_124242_Cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Absolute BSD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not finished this book, however I have to highlight its value. I’m not going to spoil any of the wit and humour for what should be a dry read, however the real value I have found looking at the inner workings of the OpenBSD operating system’s configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this help a Linux geek? Actually a surprising lot. There are a number of useful tips on running a secure and stable OpenBSD server, however a lot of these tips can translate into GNU/Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good examples you can take with you on your GNU/Linux, BSD and UNIX journey include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partitioning disks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Permissions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User accounts, user limits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sudoer files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more areas covered, I’ve just named a few. If you’re having to switch between different UNIX-like OS, it is definately worth reading and dabbling into unfamiliar technology. You might learn something about your own yard!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Xan Manning</name></author><summary type="html">So my background is mostly in GNU/Linux, I’ve ditched Windows long ago and I still dabble with Mac OS X (though an older version).

Here’s a quick tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally when running in the cloud we want to be able to ditch our VMs when they misbehave rather than trying to fix them. Reincarnate, don’t resurrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, however, I am running a single VM (Digital Ocean Droplet) with Docker. I want to be able to recreate my droplet very quickly should things go wrong, but I don’t care much about 100% uptime on my personal server. The issue with this approach is that my SSD fills up quickly with multiple Docker image layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my droplet being fairly quick to restore, this would be overkill for a simple ‘disk full’ issue. I reclaim my disk space using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prune&lt;/code&gt; functions in Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The aggressive approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will clean up everything that is unused, use with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# docker system prune
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be more specific with these commands, pruning individual unused Docker objects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# docker container prune
# docker image prune
# docker network prune
# docker volume prune
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
