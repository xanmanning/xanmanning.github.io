    <p>If you have stumbled upon this site from some articles I have written then tried
to find new stuff, you may have noticed that I haven&rsquo;t posted a lot recently.
There are many reasons for this, but the main one is that I just don&rsquo;t feel
like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into too much detail, there is a lot of private stuff going
on but it feels that all of the luck we have had this year has been bad luck.</p>
<p>My wife and I have had a number of health issues, our families have been
subject to some serious health issues. We have lost a few beloved members.
In the middle of all of this, we&rsquo;ve had a car stolen from off of our drive on
the birthday of one of our lost loved ones.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote, I will be publishing an RCA for our car theft. I&rsquo;ll explain why
wireless security cameras such as smart doorbells are absolutely pointless!</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, when I get free time, I don&rsquo;t really want to &lsquo;automate&rsquo;, code
nor write.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t despair though, I am always doing daft things with computers and the
cloud. Mostly in Azure at the minute (no, I haven&rsquo;t sold out to Microsoft).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of an encrypted RAID5 with a RAID1 bcache, because why
not.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019/09/layered-block-devices.png" alt="Silly Block Device setup" /></p>
<p>If you are having a hard year and want to feel good by donating to good causes,
here are two charities worth checking out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mndassociation.org/">Motor Neurone Disease Association</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/">Cancer Research UK</a></li>
</ul>
